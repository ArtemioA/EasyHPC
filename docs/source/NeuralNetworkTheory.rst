**Neural Networks**

In simple terms, a neural network is a function with the particular ability to learn to predict complex patterns using
data.

.. latex:: Let a random vector function $\vec{Y_{M}}_{\{...\}}$, where for a input pattern vector $\vec{s}$ we have a random vector $\vec{\mathit{Y_{M}}}$ with a multivariate normal distribution $\mathcal{N_{M}}(\vec{\mu},\vec{\sigma})$ with constant variance $V\{\vec{\mathit{Y_{M}}\}}$. 

.. latex:: Were exist a relation between the expected random vector $\vec{\mathit{Y_{M}}}$ with a deep neural network and the input pattern vector $\vec{s}$.
